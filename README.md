# Predicting Profitability - Project Description

### Project Goal: The client has concerns about ongoing product sales of 4 specific product types in one of its stores (PCs, Laptops, Netbooks & Smartphones). So, we are required to analyze historical sales data and perform a sales prediction analysis to understand how these specific product types might impact sales across the enterprise.

### Data characteristics: we have been provided with historical sales data, that should be analysed to see the concerning product types behavior in the last months; and a data set with potential new products that might be added to the clients portfolio, where the sales volume should be predicted and related to their product category.

### Technical Analysis
Language used: R programming
